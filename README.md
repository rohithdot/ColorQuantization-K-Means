# ColorQuantization-K-Means
In this, we compress a given set of images using K means clustering by clustering and reducing the number of color points

Color Quantization using K-Means
Packages Used: numpy, scipy.misc,matplotlib.pyplot
Dataset Used: http://www.utdallas.edu/~axn112530/cs6375/unsupervised/images/

How to run this code:
1.Install the above packages using pip. 
2.For windows users: Open Command Line  type "python -m pip install  <package_name>" 
3.For Linux users: Open Terminal  type "pip install <package_name>" 
4.For Mac users: install OpenCV library with the help of 'HomeBrew' and pip
5.Navigate to this folder in the terminal and run the code using the following command:
     “python Code.py <Image_name> <no_of_clusters>”

  For Example: "python Code.py 1.jpg 10"
6.Find all the compressed images in the folder named "quantizedImages".
